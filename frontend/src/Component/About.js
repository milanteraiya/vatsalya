The Trust and its associated charitable entities, including Dada Bhagwan Foundation, Adalaj all non-profit spiritual organizations, undertake a broad range of activities related to their mission to fulfill the spiritual Vision of Gnani Purush Dada Bhagwan, the founder of Akram Vignan (Science of Self Realization). His two-fold Vision is that:<br />

(1) May all the people of the world live in peace and happiness.<br /> 
(2) May all those who so desire attain Moksha (liberation of the Soul from the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cycle of birth and death).
