<div className='hd'>PujyaShree Deepakbhai</div>
<div className='pp'>Pujya Deepakbhai Desai was born on May 9 1953 in Mumbai, Maharashtra, India. One day his elder brother told him about a Gnani Purush Ambalal Muljibhai Patel (fondly known as Param Pujya 'Dadashri' or Param Pujya 'Dada Bhagwan'), whose knowledge of Akram Vignan would help him concentrate in his studies. At that time, Pujya Deepakbhai was studying engineering at VJTI College in Bombay. This soft-spoken, humble and introverted young man found worldly life meaningless and cumbersome. Little did he know that meeting this Gnani would be a major turning point in his life, transforming His life beyond imagination.
On March 6 1971, Pujya Deepakbhai attained Self Realization from Param Pujya Dadashri, the enlightened One. He was seventeen years old at the time. This spiritual experience of Self Realization ignited within him a thirst for in-depth learning and understanding of the phenomenal knowledge of Akram Vignan.</div>
