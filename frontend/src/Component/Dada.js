<div className='pp'>A Gnani Purush (Enlightened One) is not only Self-Realized, but also has the spiritual power to enlighten others. Only a Gnani Purush, One who is liberated from all worldly attachments, has the power to liberate others. Self Realization or liberation cannot be acquired by reading scriptures, even if the scriptures themselves were the words of a Gnani. Self Realization can only be acquired through direct contact with a living Gnani. Such a Gnani Purush or Spiritual Master existed not too long ago amongst us. His name was Ambalal Muljibhai Patel (also lovingly known as "Dadashri" or "Dada Bhagwan").

Many people asked Param Pujya Dadashri why He allows Himself to be addressed as “Bhagwan” (God). Param Pujya Dadashri would clarify that He is not God Himself. He too bows down to the Lord, who is fully manifested within Him, referred to as Dada Bhagwan. He would explain to everyone He met, “This Lord, Dada Bhagwan also resides within all living beings. The difference is that within Me, He is completely expressed and in you, he has yet to manifest.”</div>
