<div className='hd'>Pujya Dr. NiruMaa</div>
<div className='pp'>Dr. Niruben Amin, lovingly referred to as 'Pujya Niruma', was born on December 2, 1944 in Aurangabad, India to a wealthy family. Showered with love and attention, Pujya Niruma was the youngest sibling to five elder brothers. From a very young age Pujya Niruma knew she wanted to be a doctor in service to mankind. She acquired her basic schooling in Mumbai and graduated with a medical degree from Aurangabad Medical College.

Whilst in her final year at college, her brother told her about Param Pujya Dada Bhagwan, who had the ability to give Self Realization, and told her that this knowledge was so powerful that no worldly troubles or worries would touch her. This process would take just two hours through a unique science of the Soul (Atma; the Self) called Akram Vignan. This was the first time Pujya Niruma ever heard the word 'Atma' (Soul).

On June 29 1968, Pujya Niruma met Param Pujya Dadashri for the first time in Vadodra. Instantly upon seeing him, she felt as if she had known him for many past lives and was now being reunited with him. At that time, a strong desire arose within her, 'How wonderful would it be if I could serve Param Pujya Dadashri until my final breath!' At this first meeting, in her heart, she completely surrendered herself to the Gnani.</div>
